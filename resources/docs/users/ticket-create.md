## Email Submission
> {warning} This feature will only work if your IT department has enabled it, please ask them for further information

When submitting a ticket via email there is only one field that the software is concerned with and that is the email contents, the email contents will be stripped of any styling that may be included and it is recommended to disable any email signatures. Additional data such as priority and category will automatically be filled in by the software based on a best guess algorithm.
Information regarding your Name, District, Building and room number will be filled out based on association with your Zeus account. If no account is found the Help Desk will automatically email you to inform you that your ticket was not submitted.
